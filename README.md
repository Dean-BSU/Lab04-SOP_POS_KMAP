# Lab 04 - SOP/POS and KMaps

In this lab, you’ve learned how to apply KMaps, Sum Of Products and Products of
sums to simplify digital logic equations. Then, you’ve proven out that they work
using an implemented design on your Basys3 boards.

## Lab Summary

Summarize your learnings from the lab here.

In this lab we learned how to implement k-map minimization for a 4-input boolean
function/equation. We learned how to use the minterms and maxterms to create a 
product of sums(POS) and sum of products(SOP) equation(s). We used these two 
equations along with the k-map to create a schematic in vivado that shows our 
minimization of the function was correct. 

## Lab Questions

### Why are the groups of 1’s (or 0’s) that we select in the KMap able to go across edges?

### Why are the names Sum of Products and Products of Sums?

### Open the test.v file – how are we able to check that the signals match using XOR?
